# FAN-OOP-LAB5
Lab5 of JavaScript2
1. Take the web application that accompanies this PDF doc and rename it for use with this lab. Remember also that the existing lab5.html web application loads both the JavaScript and CSS as external “documents” for the “js” and “css” folder respectively.
2. The purpose of this lab is to complete two sets of modifications to the existing application.
3. Begin by converting all the “var” variable declarations to “let” declarations. Ensure that the web application still runs correctly following this change.
4. Next convert the “Console” and “Game” constructor functions to ES6 classes. Use the practices as discussed in class and as shown in the “Classes.html” example.
5. Use getters for all the properties in both your “Game” and “Console” classes.
6. Test and debug your new version to ensure that it still executes correctly.
